## Auto Loader

The entry point for all requests to a Laravel application is the public/index.php file. All requests are directed to this file by your web server (Apache / Nginx) configuration. The index.php file doesn't contain much code. Rather, it is a starting point for loading the rest of the framework.

It loads the auto loader files which is generated by composer.

Then it retrieves an instance of the Laravel application frombootstrap/app.php script. Laravel itself creates an instance of the application, is the initial/first step.
